PlateMines allows the server owner to decide what redstone devices a player will no longer be allowed to interact with (specifically pressureplates and tripwires).

This simplistic plugin is designed to add some additional help for people that want their players to have restrictions or punishments for touching specific redstone based items.

Features:

    Configuration file to allow the server owner to set what the players can still use. 

Notes:

    Currently there are no flags to use for areas, it is done globally.
